## ABOUT US 
BPIT Org. is the official Open source organization of Bhagwan Parshuram Institute of Technology Delhi. As a part of the Institute Technical Council, we aim to provide a gateway for the students in our institute to join the coding community. We create a platform which allows students to gain assistance and mentorship to enhance their coding ability. Our aim is to propagate the enthusiasm for coding in the institute and especially amongst freshmen. We believe that every student here at BPIT should have an opportunity to learn how to code and develop a passion for it. The secret of getting ahead is getting started and we aim to provide every student with the right start.
